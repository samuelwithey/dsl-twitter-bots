\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Problem Area}

In Q1 2020, there were 166 million Monetizable Daily Active Users (mDAU) worldwide on Twitter, a 5.2\% increase compared to Q4 2019. This rapid social paradigm shift has transformed consumer behaviour and social interaction through online social platforms which allows instantaneous direct communication. This has provided unbounded limitations for brands to connect and engage directly with their audiences. Managing large amounts of content on Twitter is an intricate task as the standard Twitter web application provides limited functionality for automation.

\section{Aims and Objectives}

The overall goal of this project is to provide a unique solution to the issues around managing social media content on Twitter. There are several tools which allow for this functionality, however they are often closed source and hidden behind a pay-wall. This prevents the standard Twitter user from accessing the functionality of automation, making it difficult and a time-consuming task to manage large amounts of content. The aim of the project is to design and implement an open-source domain specific language and an interpreter to configure and operate a variety of Twitter bots. This solution will bridge the gap between the novice Twitter user and the functionality of the Twitter API. The domain specific language will provide the user with the core functionality of what can be achieved on Twitter with added functionality of the Twitter API including scheduling and automating content.

\section{User Needs}

The users of the system will see a novel solution to Twitter content management, automation and bots. Social media management tools and dashboards such as Hootsuite provide a single platform to schedule, monitor, analyse and curate social media content. The project aims to include the functionality that these social media management tools provide with the extension of automated bots. This solution allows non-programmers to easily interact with Twitter bots and utilise the Twitter API functionality, providing more functionality to the users of these platforms. The system will provide the functionality for users to upload a program, with a syntax closely aligned to their domain, easily execute the program and have the tools to monitor the interactions of the bots and the social media content. The project aims to fulfill the users needs and provide a novel solution which could be used by brands and individuals over an extended period of time.

\section{Project Motivation}

The project motivation is to explore the concept of creating a small, lightweight language to automate Twitter content through the use of Twitter bots. The motivation to do this is to provide a unique solution to user needs, through the user of industry-standard tools. The project aims to use the latest parser generator tools, web-frameworks, web-services and social media API's. The reason for using these tools and services is to develop my skills further and explore the concept of developing a modern solution, based on key principles of computer science to a modern problem.
