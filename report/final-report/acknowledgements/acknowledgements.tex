\begin{acknowledgements}

I would first like to thank my supervisor, Ian Wakeman, whose expertise was invaluable and support was much appreciated throughout the entire process and a challenging second term. \newline \par

Also, I would like to thank my parents, who have provided emotional support and a sympathetic ear throughout the entire duration of the course and critical moments of the final year project.
