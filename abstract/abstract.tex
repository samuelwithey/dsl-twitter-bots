\begin{abstract}

The increase of users on social media platforms provides a new way for users and brands to connect with their audiences. This report explores the concept of designing, building and implementing a lightweight language to automate social media content and interactions through Twitter bots. Using Twitter bots is often outside the competence level of the typical Twitter user. The project aims to provide a novel solution to connect the average Twitter user with the features and automation of Twitter bots. The solution is achieved by a domain specific language using the latest parser generator tools to bridge the gap of the Twitter API to the novice user. The project provides a web-application using modern web-frameworks to provide a user interface to interact with the language and to make the project accessible to all users.
